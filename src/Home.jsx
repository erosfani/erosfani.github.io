          I am an ELLIS Ph.D. candidate at the Visual and Multimodal Applied Learning Laboratory (VANDAL) of the
          Artificial Intelligence Hub (AIH) at the Polytechnic University of Turin (PoliTO), and a Research Fellow at the
          Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM). My research is focused on Heterogeneity in Federated Learning (FL)
          for real-world vision applications. I also possess expertise in Semantic Segmentation (SS), Domain Adaptation &
          Generalization, and Semi-Supervised Learning. I have recently completed my ELLIS Mobility period at the
          University of Sussex, advised by Prof. Novi Quadrianto. I am always eager to contribute to groundbreaking
          advancements and willing to unlock unparalleled opportunities for my professional development.
